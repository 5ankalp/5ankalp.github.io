Namaste, Hello, Privet, Annyeonghaseyo… and all the greetings of the world to you!

Before you get to know me, think for a second- Why are you here? How did you end up on my blog? Maybe you were just surfing the crazy world of the internet and stumbled upon this; maybe you wanted to be here in the first place; it is also possible that you are here to dox me ;)
Whatever reason you are here for, welcome!


Now, my name is Sankalp. I am a 21 years old student(?) and more importantly a “Hacker.” Not the type you’re probably thinking of! However, I like CyberSecurity, Psychology, Finance, Philosophy, and anything that intrigues me.
